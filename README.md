# [Noodle Stats](https://almoturg.com/noodle)

A website to show some statistics & photos of my Western Hognose snake Noodle. View at [almoturg.com/noodle](https://almoturg.com/noodle).

I manually enter the statistics into a Google sheet, and add the photos to a google photos album.
A github actions workflow pulls the data from there once a day, does some processing,
and uploads everything to the webserver (see data_update directory).
